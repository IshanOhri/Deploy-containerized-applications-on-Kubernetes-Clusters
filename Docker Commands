Docker Basic Commands

Basic

docker version
docker -v  --------> Check the version of docker
docker info
docker --help
docker login

Images

docker images --help -------------> gives the usage of the docker images command.
docker pull image_name------------> Pull images from the docker hub.
docker pull <image_name:tag> -----> Particular tag images can be pulled using this command otherwise the latest tag images will be pulled.
docker images --------------------> List out all the images on the system.
docker images -a -----------------> List all the images available on your system.
docker images -f------------------> Filter flag in which you can provide some filter.

Example -  sudo docker images -f "dangling=false"
           dangling images are the images which are associated with the conatiners or running conatiners.
		 
Example -  sudo docker images -f "dangling=false" - q
           Show us the images Id's which are not associated with the conatiners.

docker images -q -----------------> Quiet falg which gives you only image Id's.
docker run image_name ------------> Running an image means actually creating container out of images.
docker rmi


Containers

docker ps --help ------> will list out all the sub options under this command.
docker ps -------------> shows the running conatiners in the system.
docker ps --all--------> shows all the conatiners created till now.
docker run -it image_name bash --------> used to run the conatiner.
     it is the interactive mode flag for going inside the conatiners
	 bash to start an interactive mode. So that we can start the shell.
	 We can also give the name to this conatiner by using below command
	 docker run --name MyUbuntu1-it image_name bash 
	 ls ----> command takes you inside the container system
docker start
docker stop

docker run image_name = docker create image_name + docker start conatiner_id ---> docker run command will create and run the conatiner.
																			 ---> It's a combination of above two commands.
																			 
																			 
docker exec -it <conatiner_id> <command>   ------> execute an additional command in a conatiner.
                                           ------> the purpose of the IT flag is to get into the container.
										   ------> exec means run another command.
										   ------> Reference the docker client.
										   ------> open shell or terminal in context of your running container. docker exec -it  <conatiner_id> sh
										   ------> this will take you inside the container and you can run command directly.
										   ------> We can directly start the shell/terminal while running the image/creating the conatiner.
										   ------> docker run -it <image_name> sh
										   ------> this will take you inside the container shell/terminal. Drawback is you cannot run any other process.
