***************************************  Install Chocolatey Pacakge Manager on Windows 10   ******************************************

If you want to make your experience with Windows a more fulfilling experience, then you really need to install the Chocolatey package 
manager. This package manager for Windows will make installing the programs you need, easier, and give you an experience that is similar 
to having a package manager that you would find on Mac and Linux.

Steps to install chocolatey:

      1. Open a command line window as administrator.
      
      2. Then install Chocolatey using the Windows command line prompt using the following command.
      @"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
      
      3. Once your setup is complete you are ready to go. Give it a try by installing git or installing kubectl on your Windows computer.
      
      4. If you would prefer a visual experience for Chocolatey packages, you can also install a GUI for Chocolatey using the package 
         manager command: choco install chocolateygui.
         
      5. You can open the Choclatey GUI from the start menu.
