***************************************************What is MiniKube?*************************************************************

Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine
(VM) on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.
    
    1. Minikube is the best option to learn Kubernetes on your personal computer. 
    2. It is the easiest and most recommended way to run an All-in-One Kubernetes cluster locally.
    3. So without expensive infrastructure, you can work with Kubernetes clusters using Mnikube from your workstation.
    
*******************************************Perequisites for installing Minikube**************************************************

    1. kubectl: it is a command line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters.
    2. The first thing you will need in order to begin is a hypervisor to run the Minikube virtual machine
        Hypervisor like VirtualBox or Hyper-V should be installed on the computer.
        
        
        
Instead of manually installing all the packages for Minikube, you can install all prerequisites at once using the Chocolatey package manager. To install Minikube you can use the following command in the PowerShell:
        choco install minikube -y


Package managers are nice when you are wanting to install dependencies quickly.



        
        
        Another option of running Kubernetes locally is to use Minikube. In general, Minikube is a vbox instance running Linux and docker-daemon pre-installed. 
        If you want to run Windows containers then Docker-For-Windows is the only possible choice. Minikube will only run Linux based containers (in a VM).
